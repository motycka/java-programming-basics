# Throwing Exceptions

## CollectionsTask

Implement a `ConnectionHandler` class with the following methods:
 - `connect()` - connects to the server on the given port. If the server is not available, it should throw a `ConnectionException`.
 - `ping()` - sends a message to the server. If the server is not available, it should throw a `ConnectionException`.
