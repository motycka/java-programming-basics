# Abstraction

1. Define an **interface** called **Shape2D**, which is going to represent 2-dimensional objects. It should have the following methods:
 - `double area();`
 - `double perimeter();`

2. Define an **interface** called **Shape3D**, which is going to represent 3-dimensional objects. It should have the following methods:
 - `double volume();`
 - `double surfaceArea();`

3. Now update your Rectangle class to **implement** the **Shape2D** interface.
