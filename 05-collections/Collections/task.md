## Java Collections Framework

The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement common collection data structures and operations on them, such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

It is part of the **java.util** package.

A collection in general represents a group of objects known as its elements.

Java Collections Framework has these main components:
 - Interfaces
 - Implementations
 - Algorithms

Here are some (not all )of the most commonly used interfaces and their implementations:
 - **List**
   - **ArrayList**
   - **LinkedList**
 - **Set**
    - **HashSet**
    - **LinkedHashSet**
    - **TreeSet**
 - **Queue**
    - **PriorityQueue**
 - **Map**
   - **HashMap**
   - **TreeMap**
   - **LinkedHashMap**
