# HOMEWORK: Java Collections

Based on the last exercise, try to create a method that will aggregate the data based on first letter.

Create a **public static** method `aggregateByLetter` which takes one argument `List<String>` data and returns a `Map<String, List<String>>`. 

For example, the result should look like this:
```
A -> [Aileen Ochoa, Alvin Fisher, Aaron Sears]
B -> []
C -> [Caleb Bullock, Cassidy Donaldson, Cassidy Donaldson]
D -> [Dora Skinner, Duncan Clark]
E -> [Emerson Bentley, Emerson Bentley]
...
```
