## Arithmetic Operators, Arrays, For Loop

Write a program that calculates **simple arithmetic mean** for two sets od data, wind speed and wind direction, 
represented as double[] and byte[] respectively, using for loop.

Print the result to the console. Make sure the wind direction is printed as a whole number.

Example output:
```
Average wind speed: <decimal number>
Average wind direction: <whole number>
```
