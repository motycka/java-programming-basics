# Data Types

There are two groups of data types in Java, **primitive** and **non-primitive**.

Primitive data types:
- **byte** - 8-bit signed two's complement integer
- **short** - 16-bit signed two's complement integer
- **int** - 32-bit signed two's complement integer
- **long** - 64-bit signed two's complement integer
- **float** - 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
- **double** - 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
- **boolean** - true or false
- **char** - 16-bit Unicode character

Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
Example of non-primitive data type is **String**, which is used to store text.
