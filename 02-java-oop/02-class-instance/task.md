## Instantiate MeteoStation class

Now that we have [MeteoStation.java](file://lesson-02/02-class-instance/src/com/harbourspace/model/MeteoStation.java) class, let's create an instance of it.

1. Go to the [com.harbourspace.Main.java](file://lesson-02/02-class-instance/src/com/harbourspace/app/com.harbourspace.Main.java) file in **com.harbourspace.app** package. Implement main method in this file.

2. Create instance of **MeteoStation** inside the main method, assign it to variable,

3. Finally, print subject to the console using the **name** property of the Course class instance.

You may be having problem accessing the name property. Can you figure out and how to fix it?
